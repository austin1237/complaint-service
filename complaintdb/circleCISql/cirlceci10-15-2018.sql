My payment went up with this version of the HAMP but I was told my ex husband who is on the loan would be removed with this new HAMP. So, in order to get my ex husband off the loan I agreed and signed the HAMP. When I received the HAMP paperwork, I was shocked and dismayed my ex husband was still on the paperwork and I got a higher interest rate. Upon calling my rep, he explained that he would attach my divorce decree and quit claim deed where the property was quit claimed to me solely by my ex husband that this would remove his name from the loan. So, I signed and returned the paperwork regardless of the higher rate to attain this end. I attaching the email from the Nationstar rep stating that his name would be removed. I signed the paperwork with my ex husbands name on it without his signature. Nationstar signed and recorded this document ( see attached ). My ex husband served me with a lawsuit for not making payments, ruined his credit, and for not taking him off the loan.

When XXXX realized the mistake they filed a motion for relief. I was instructed by my attorney to hold my house payments until the outcome of the hearing. The outcome that was settled on was for me to remit a payment of XXXX and to make XXXX additional pymts of XXXX each month beginning on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All payments were sent to and deposited by nationstar as they had purchased my mortgage at this time. I am not behind in my mortgage payments. Nationstar continues to send letters that I am behind and I just simply want them research this and get this issue resolved.

I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest Key Bank \'s posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n\'t low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that \'s Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I \'m posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people \'s balances. I do n\'t even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n\'t know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank \'s accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son \'s account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business. They do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that I have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance. Get it together Key Bank. Adding and Subtracting are basic math skills that you should have. Stop reordering items to benefit yourselves. Give people a break.

The dealer told me that I would be contacted by Citizen One ( then RBS Citizens ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due. Sometime shortly after that Citizen One sent me my first monthly billing statement. For the next 2 1/2 years Citizen One set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements. During that time I faithfully made each payment on time and, on several occasions, made monthly payments for several months in advance. For these reasons I relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from Citizen One to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment. In XXXX XXXX Citizen One suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements. I did n\'t notice ( I had been habituated by their monthly notices and I had been trained to think of sending a payment only after I was notified ) and, as a direct result of Citizen One \'s failure to send a monthly billing statement, I was late with my XXXX payment. When their credit department contacted me I sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that I had n\'t received a statement. Their customer service representative told me that I should have received a monthly billing statement, it was Citizen One \'s policy to do so, verified my contact information ( which had n\'t changed ) and, under the circumstances, waived the {$20.00} fee I had been assessed for being late. She also assured me that I would start to receive monthly billing statements again. Unfortunately, I did not. Nor did I notice. As a result of that failure on the part of Citizen One I was again contacted in XXXX by their credit department that I was late again. I immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me. Mail it, fax it, e-mail it - I did n\'t care. Just get one to me. This time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders. To date I have n\'t received either. As a result I was late again in XXXX. I am not accusing Citizen One of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but I find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident. I am never - and I do mean never - late with any of my other bills. I also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that Citizen One gains from their own failure! They are now refusing to waive XXXX {$20.00} late fees. Something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that I am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due. Furthermore, I should not be charged {$20.00} fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on Citizen One \'s part to send me a monthly billing statement.

I knew that IRS rules provided that the named spouse beneficiary \" assumes the account. \'\' However, when I called to discuss the situation I was told the account would be closed and funds sent to me. I specifically said I did not want the account to be closed. I followed this up with a letter the same day reiterating my wish that the account not be closed and asking that someone contact me about the proper handling of the account. I heard nothing. When I followed up with a phone call, I was told the account was closed and a check was on the way to me. I spoke with several people, all of whom told me the account had to be closed. However, I knew IRS publication XXXX indicated that upon death of account holder, the \" account is treated as the spouse \'s HSA. \'\' The major problem with their closing the account was that they did it around XX/XX/XXXX -- against my wishes -- and at a time when the value of investments in the account had plunged. These investments soon rebounded and even gained in value. However, I missed out on these earnings. I filed a complained with the BBB and the bank restored opened an account in my name and cancelled payment on the check to me. However, the bank has refused to provide me with information about the value of the account as of the date of my husband \'s death and the holdings in the investment accounts as of his death and as of the date they sold the investments. As the law says I should \" assume \'\' this account, I am entitled to this information. I have attempted to get the information from the bank but they refuse. I have no way to know if they restored the correct amount to the account. The bank later made a cash deposit to the account, apparently correcting some error. However, I have no information to assess what they have done. In effect, the bank erroneously made the only investment decisions for the account until I sold the investments in XX/XX/XXXX as I prepare to move the account to an HSA administrator that is more professional. The bank \'s website information about the treatment of HSA accounts upon accountholder \'s death has changed more than once since my husband \'s death and now says the bank has discretion about the treatment of accounts upon death. Are accountholders subject to the whims of a bank clerk? I believe the bank has callously violated my rights and that I have suffered a financial loss as a result. Without all of the required information, it is difficult to assess the damage, but I believe that if the account had simply been changed to my name there would be several more thousand dollars in it than there is now. To make matters worse, this debacle occurred when I was already struggling with the effects of my husband \'s death. While other financial institutions were careful to provide detailed information accounts and options, Bank of America ignored my request for information and closed the account without any consideration of the effect it would have on its value.

The date of first delinquency determines how long a negative account can remain on your credit reports and a negative credit item, such as a charge-off can only remain on my credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency.

A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action. \'\' This means that if a debt collector reports a date of first delinquency to the credit bureaus and the original creditor previously reported it, the dates must be the same date of first delinquency.

If the federal government shuts down for any reason, we would not be able to pay our mortgage. This would be no fault of ours! With this being said, if Ocwen Loan Servicing or any other company dealing with our mortgage loan tries to foreclosure in the future especially without the proper documentation, our attorney and I will request to go to foreclosure mediation where we will in fact inform the court of the fraud and robo-signing that has occurred with this loan! \nNow ; as Ocwen Loan Servicing is fully aware, we had a modification on XXXX XXXX XXXX from Litton Loan Servicing. We started paying on that modification when we found that the modification was fraudulent and stopped paying. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, Litton Loan Servicing filed for foreclosure and recorded this document with the XXXX County Recorder \'s Office. We are fully aware, per the Security Exchange Commission that XXXX is the master servicer. The role of a master servicer is an entity that acts on behalf of a trustee for security holders \' benefit in collecting funds from borrower, advancing funds in the event of delinquencies and in the event of default, taking a property through foreclosure. We are requesting the following questions to be answered and provide documentation. \nFirst, did XXXX participate with our foreclosure ( s ) dated XXXX XXXX XXXX? \nSecond, who or which company has Ocwen Loan Servicing been sending our monthly mortgage payments to each month? \nKeep in mind ; failure to respond by answering my questions and failing to provide documentation as requested may appear that Ocwen Loan Servicing is hiding something that maybe against the law! If Ocwen does not have this information, Ocwen can request this information from the appropriate company or companies! Failing to answer and provide documentation as requested will result in more complaints and action taken against Ocwen Loan Servicing!','','2016-10-04',1,1),(946,17,1,28,6,'','','2012-08-07',1,1),(947,64,5,5,36,'','','2015-06-26',1,0),(948,5,1,1,13,'','','2015-01-16',1,0),(949,31,7,17,12,'','Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response','2017-04-18',1,0),(950,67,5,13,52,'','','2013-10-01',1,0),(951,33,5,24,12,'','','2014-04-13',1,0),(952,212,5,10,17,'Called XXXX verified they sent me a letter verifying this account was closed in XX/XX/XXXX.

I \'ve been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. \n\nTonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with \" XXXX \'\' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site \'s issues. \n\nThere is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB \'s employees \' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.','Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers','2017-04-04',1,0),(975,8,2,2,52,'','','2014-06-24',1,0),(976,10,1,15,46,'','','2014-01-26',1,0),(977,17,1,1,57,'','','2015-02-15',1,1),(978,198,7,14,17,'','','2015-01-14',1,0),(979,89,7,22,17,'','','2013-03-28',1,0),(980,2,2,2,43,'','Company chooses not to provide a public response','2015-04-22',1,0),(981,27,7,17,13,'','Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response','2017-04-04',1,0),(982,67,5,13,29,'','','2014-07-29',1,0),(983,174,7,17,17,'','Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law','2017-04-10',1,0),(984,236,5,10,52,'','Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law','2015-07-01',1,1),(985,5,1,1,57,'','','2012-10-02',1,0),(986,8,2,32,30,'I tried to register with credit cards so I could see my credit report and score. Well when in want to set up my account and put in my info i got to where they were asking the questions2 identify me and all but 1 of the questions had nothing to do with me so i answered none of the above because it was asking about a mortgage loan companys name and car loan payment amount that I had never heard about or seen before to verify my identity so I thought it was a trick question for both if them so as I said I answered none of the above. Well it would n\'t verify my identity since it said i got them wrong. Well so then I tried to scan my license front and back as it requested for 4 and half hours over and over to get to my report 2 make sure no1 had taken my identity and a loan in my name but it would n\'t confirm with the scans of my drivers license either. So tgen I wrote the company XXXX and told thrm my issue and they responded that they were sorry that if I ca n\'t be verified then I ca n\'t get and register an account with them for my reports that I would have to request the reports individually on the XXXX websites. So i went to the XXXX bureaus I requested all XXXX. I only ended up with my XXXX report and none of the otuer XXXX because I had the same problem with 1 of them in answering the verifying personal account questions and the other said i already requested my report this year but i did n\'t the only time I have applied was to XXXX and i never made it thru 2 get or request my reports on their site.
